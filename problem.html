			<h2>The Users</h2>
			<p>A small group of friends, family, or roommates who want a fair and predictable way to share a car.</p>
			<p>This could be group of graduate students who pooled their resources to lease a car, now they need to share the car fairly. Or it could be a family with several driving age children and only one car between them who need a way to manage access and share fairly. Or it could be a band of carless musicians trying to keep track of their tour van for business expenses on the road and personal use when at home.The system aims to immerse interactors in an environment through the tangible key object to perform tasks like reserving a car, performing scheduling activity or going for a quick ride. This is useful to respect our user-centric goals and complete tasks in a few clicks. This interface will replace having to navigate through a traditional mouse and keyboard interface for most use cases, while providing the alternate interface when the user requires it. </p>

			<h2>Their Problem</h2>
			<p>
			Design an interactive system to facilitate sharing so that 
users can easily plan trips, see the status and availability of the car, and track and control individual and shared use.</p>
			<p>Looking ahead, think about a world where energy is more scarce, and car ownership is more expensive. Imagine that we need a way to support widespread access to cars, but still limit the overall number of cars in the world and on the roads.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>Our Goals</h2>
			<p>Support use of keys and car in a way that is natural and familiar to users. Extend the Driver:Key:Car relation of ownership.
			</p>
			<p>Provide users with a simple record keeping system that  automatically tracks the information about who uses the car, when they use it, where they go, and when the users carpool.
			</p>
			<p>Allow users to plan their needs for the car in advance so that they can plan around each other.
			</p>
			<p>Encourage sharing through visibility, convenience, and a fun interface to let users combine trips and reduce consumption.
			</p>
			<p>Enable 'grab-the-keys-and-go' functionality so that every user feels like they own a share of the car.
			</p>
			<p>Create constraints for access which give preference to advance reservations, but still permit last minute use (if the car is free).
