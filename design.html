				<h2>Refining Our Problem</h2>
				<p>We focused on re-examining the problem space and user group in conjunction with initial brainstorming of design directions. Our initial research had led us to define our user group as Chinese graduate students attending Georgia Tech who had been in the country for less than two years and had a desire for more flexible transportation options. Our reasoning in picking such a relatively narrow user group was in order to allow a focused and highly appropriate design. We did not want to choose students from India, as we decided we might be biased in performing our user research, and we decided that focusing on the specific needs of Chinese international students would allow us to employ user-centered design effectively. In addition, data from the Office of International Education indicated that Chinese students represented a large portion of the Georgia Tech community.</p><p>
Based on feedback from P1, we decided that it would be more appropriate to abstract the relevant core characteristics of this user group, and generalize this to a greater number of people. As such, in this meeting we refined our usergroup to 'people who want to share a car.' This pointed us to a problem space of 'how do we help people share a car.' We then began brainstorming ideas for ways to solve this problem for this group of users.</p>
				<p>Our first set of solutions were like plug- ins for Zipcar, or for single and multiple cars, since our user group was not yet constrained to people living together. During this initial session, we considered several interaction models and conceptual metaphors.</p><p>
These included a web interface, a physical ID device + communal 'panel' interface, an interactive key rack with display, a key sensing bowl next to the door. Several ideas focused on ways to tap into the communal spaces in shared living situations. We also discussed a system called Zip Split that would integrate with Facebook in order to allow for social ride sharing. We also put forward various approaches to encouraging fair usage amounts, including various monthly allotment resource metaphors. After seeding the design space with these different ideas and directions, we decided to split up and spend some time doing individual, divergent ideation.</p>

				<h2>Problem Focus</h2>
				<p>
				Our second meeting was focused on synthesizing and discussing the results of our individual brainstorming efforts.  We then endeavored to converge on 3-4 solid (but differing) ideas that we could develop further.</p>
				<p>After seeing that some of the ideas we had come up with were presupposing slightly different user groups and problem spaces, we decided to refine these once again.  We defined our final user group as "People who live together and want to share a car".  Since our designs could be plugged into existing systems, we also decided to disregard the problem of car ownership. Our goal was now restated as "To allow the target user group to share a car fairly". In this context, "share" would focus on the logistics of managing a shared environment, and not on the particulars of co-ownership.  Finally, we chose to narrow our problem space to sharing of a single car, housed at a central location.  These refinements finally gave us a manageable space in which to discuss our ideas.</p>
				<p>We discussed four main ideas, and wrote out their important features and distinctions:
<ol>
<li>Web app that can organize ad hoc communities around multiple cars
</li><li>Key+, a combination of a single smart key, a set of ID nodes, a base station, and a web app</li>
<li>'Dumb' keychain RFID token that interacts with software running in the car in order to track usage data</li>
<li>Central kiosk with a keychain token that supports communal discovery and natural interaction.</li></ol></p>
				<p>After doing this, it became evident that the 'Key+' idea and the idea about in-car systems and keychain RFID  could be consolidated- in between this and the next meeting, two of us worked to merge these ideas.  We decided not to pursue the pure web application idea, as we needed to be able to ensure that awareness of the status of the car could be guaranteed at all times, and that the best way to do this was with a physical token of some sort.  Elements of this web app would later resurface in the design of the smartphone app.  We also decided that we needed to flesh out the kiosk+ token idea more, and to further differentiate this from the other ideas.  We agreed to flesh out three ideas: Key+, the Web App, and the Central Tablet + Token.</p>

			<h2>Vision Meets Design</h2>
			<p>We now began the process of translating our ideas for the mobile app, Key+ and the Token/Kiosk into early designs. The web app had been refined into a clear and uncomplicated awareness system in which users could perform basic tasks with high fluidity.  We discussed a metaphor of the car as a family 'dog' in the 'doghouse.'  The mobile app idea had less flexibility than the original web app (which had supported multiple cars), but we decided that it was elegant in that it did not require users to carry around a dedicated device, and still provided unambiguous awareness information despite not being such a dedicated device.</p>
			<p>the the kiosk  and token model.  The idea came from considering the watch, which is something that people regularly consult in order to check time and status.  We figured that this was the same thing users would want to do with the shared car, and that co-opting the watch metaphor was appropriate.  In addition, were inspired by the visual of a solidarity bracelet (a livestrong band) to help engender feelings of group membership.  The idea was to provide a strong metaphor for group membership and persistent awareness of the car's activities, and to support natural social gestures between group members, the car, and the kiosk.  We discussed alternative ways of using the wheelman band.  It was conceptualized as having an accelerometer to support interactions like miming the turning of the key, tapping the car wheel/ door to automatically reserve time, and bumping fists to transfer the usage allotment resource.  This in turn led to interesting ideas for the smartphone app- perhaps the phone itself could be rotated as if it were a key, thus turning on the car.  We realized that one of our broad overall goals was to maintain the traditional concept of the key in some form, in order to increase the familiarity and acceptance of our system.</p>	
			<p>On the other hand, Key+ remained a strong metaphor for individual ownership, and had a focus on physical permissions (that is, either you had the key or you didn't!).  While doing our user research, we had noted that both of these (feelings of ownership and feeling of group membership) were important.  After looking at the other designs, we realized that we would actually need to have some vehicle awareness information on the user keychain IDs, which had previously been simply memory cards with RFID.  As such, we changed the model.  Rather than a dumb keychain item, we would now give each user a smart keychain half-key (like the electronics of a key, without the metal prong), and have them lock the metal prong into this when they needed the car.  The obvious problem here is what happens if someone loses the prong (which was brought up in our poster session).  We chose not to worry about this issue until the prototyping stage.  We also spent some time discussing rough concepts for the Key+ web portal.</p>
